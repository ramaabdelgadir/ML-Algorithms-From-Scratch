# ML Algorithms From Scratch

This repo contains classic machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using only NumPy. The goal is to understand the inner workings of each algorithm and compare the performance with scikit-learn's built-in models.

## Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Means Clustering
- k-Nearest Neighbors
